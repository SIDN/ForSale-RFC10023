# ♻️ ForSale - Advanced usage

Here are some more (advanced) examples. See [RFC10023](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc10023) for all details.

## 🌐 Unicode

~~~
_for-sale.example.nl.	1800	IN	TXT	"v=FORSALE1;ftxt=人間が読める形式の情報がここにあります。"
_for-sale.example.nl.	1800	IN	TXT	"v=FORSALE1;ftxt=ᛞᚨᚷᚱ ᛖᚱ ᛒᛃᚨᚱᛏ"
_for-sale.example.nl.	1800	IN	TXT	"v=FORSALE1;furi=https://⠎⠑⠁⠎⠕⠝⠎⠛⠗⠑⠑⠞⠊⠝⠛⠎.sidnlabs.nl/"
_for-sale.example.nl.	1800	IN	TXT	"v=FORSALE1;fval=JPY235566"
~~~

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unicode characters should be [encoded as UTF-8](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f600/index.htm), like this: 😀 (U+1F600) → `F0 9F 98 80`

> [!CAUTION]
> It is not always possible to enter Unicode directly in DNS records and zonefiles. Sometimes a [presentation format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-5.1) has to be used.
> Like this: 😀 (U+1F600) → `F0 9F 98 80` → `_for-sale.example.nl.	1800	IN	TXT	"v=FORSALE1;ftxt=\240\159\152\128"`

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that representing a '😀' in a ForSale TXT record consumes not one, but four characters as the example above shows.

> [!TIP]
> This little one liner might help to test things: `dig TXT _for-sale.example.nl +short | perl -pe 's/\\([0-9]{3})/chr($1)/ge'`

## 🛒 Is there a quick way to generate 'presentation format' ?

Yes! Try this:

```
python3 -c "
s = 'v=FORSALE1;ftxt=😀'; 
print(''.join(c if ord(c) < 128 else ''.join(f'\\\\{b:03d}' for b in c.encode('utf-8')) for c in s))
"
```
The output will be:

`v=FORSALE1;ftxt=\240\159\152\128`

Obvisously this is just a simple quick example. There are probably better ways.

## 🤖 What is the `fcod=` tag used for?

The `fcod=` tag is a flexible code that only has meaning for parties that have agreed on how to use it. It acts as a private instruction between cooperating systems, such as a domain registry and its registrars, and can be used to control what happens when a domain is for sale - for example, which page is shown or how information is displayed. It has no universal meaning, and outsiders should not attempt to interpret it.

### 🧩 A few `fcod=` examples:

💡 **Encoded proprietary landing page URL**

A domain name registry may allow registrars to enter a "for sale" URL into its back-end system. From that URL, a unique code is generated. This code is then inserted as the value of the `fcod=`content tag in the "_for-sale" TXT record of a domain name, for example:

`_for-sale.example.nl. 1800 IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fcod=URL-S2lscm95IHdhcyBoZXJl"`

💡 **Arbitrary formatting or conditional display instructions**

A party may include proprietary code containing arbitrary formatting or conditional display instructions, such as adding an extra banner (for example, "eligibility criteria apply") or specifying a particular style, including color, font, emojis, or logos. For example:

`_for-sale.example.nl. 1800 IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fcod=CSS-AGgAMQAgAHsAZgBvAG4AdAAtAHcAZQBpAGcAaAB0ADoAIAA3ADAAMAB9"`

`_for-sale.example.nl. 1800 IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fcod=LOGO-AHMAYQBsAGUALgBqAHAAZw=="`

💡 **Digital signatures**

A party could include a digital signature for various reasons, for example to prove that it has validated a particular furi= value. For example:

`_for-sale.example.nl. 1800 IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fcod=SIG-AGQAYQBzAGQAYQBzAGQACg=="`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember: `fcod=` content values only have meaning between parties that have agreed on their use. They have no universal meaning, unlike the `furi=` and `fval=` content tag-value pairs. Let us know if you use it for something cool!
